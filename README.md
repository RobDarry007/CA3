CA 3: CSS+GIT
This assessment item requires you to submit a HTML page to which you have added CSS to make it appear as if it is from the height of 1996 web page design. The CSS must:

Set the heading to display in white with the text at 130% size and be aligned to the center.
Show paragraph and list elements text in yellow and 100% size.
Draw a box around the paragraphs and the list with a white solid border at 1 pixel and with 5 pixels of padding.
Give the table a border (1 pixel, white and solid), set the text colors to white, and include 5 pixels of padding.
You must NOT use inline CSS. You can submit the HTML and CSS as two separate files; or you can include the CSS in the HTML as internal CSS.
You can make changes to the HTML if required.
The web page should appear something like:



Your HTML filename should use the format: CA3_Firstname_Lastname.html       (example: CA3_Tim_Simon.html)
Any other files should use the same filename but a different and appropriate extension (eg: .css)

You should also make sure that you've committed this file to a git repository, and pushed this commit to your GitHub account.
